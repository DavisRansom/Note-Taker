# Note-Taker
A simple note taking app that allows users to add, recall, or delete notes.

# Description
This Note-taker app allows users to create, save for later, and delete reminder notes. This application allows users to easily set notes, and then come back to them at a later time for reminders. 

# Installing
The Note-Taker application can be found at: https://github.com/DavisRansom/Note-Taker
There is no installation necessary.

# Executing Program
All a user has to do to use the Note-Taker is type in the area that says New Note, then, in the area below that they can provide a description of what the note is reminding them of. After the user has input their information he/she will hit the save button and the note will be saved to the side of the screen for viewing later. The user simply clicks on the note that he/she wants to review and it will come up in the main portion of the screen to be edited, read, or deleted.

# Step-by-step bullets
*In the terminal run npm start
*Next, in the terminal run node server.js
*Then, in the browser navigate to the home address for this application: localhost:3000
*Type the note name into the New Note title area
*Type details about the note in the information area
*When the user has completed the note, he/she will click on the Save button (which looks like a floppy disk) in the top right corner of the page
*The note will then be saved to the left side of the screen
*When a user wants to view that note, he/she clicks on the note and it will be displayed into the body of the page
*When the user no longer needs the note, he/she will just bring up the note by using the step above, and the clicking on the delete button (which looks like a trash can) in the top right corner of the page
